# Golang examples
Golang is a language developed by Google, and produces an executable output and which also matches well with the C programming langauge. It is generally faster than Python, and also integrates well with GitHub code. To install a library, we basically get the GitHub link and get the code:

<pre>
go get [Git url]
</pre>
and then to build we use:
<pre>
go build mycode.go
</pre>
