# Outline outcomes

Students should:

1. Understand the conversion of characters between hex, decimal and octal. Sample question: Convert "hello" into a hex stream. Related material: [here](https://asecuritysite.com/Coding/ascii).
1. Compute the GCD for values. Sample question: What is the GCD for 42 and 56? Related material: [here](http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/gcd).
1. Understand how to manually convert from ASCII to Base-64, and vice-versa. Sample question: What is the Base-64 conversion of “hello”? [here](https://asecuritysite.com/Coding/ascii).
1. Understand the concept of key entropy and how it is used to calculate the equivalent key sizes. Sample question: What is the key entropy size for 1,024 pass phrases? Related material: [here](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/en).
1. Calculate the time taken to crack a code given a time to try each key, and for the number of processing elements. Sample question: If it takes 100 years to crack a cipher code, and computing power doubles each year. How long will it take to crack a code after five years?
1. Understand the full process used for providing privacy and identity within public key encryption. Sample question: Explain the public key encryption process. Related material: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQQOtZw2GQ).
1. Define the process used in public key encryption, including the generation of the keys and the calculation of the cipher message. Sample question: If two prime numbers of 3 and 5 are selected, what are the values for N and PHI? Related material: [here](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/rsa).
1. Understand the features of differing encryption methods such as AES, DES, 3DES and PGP. Sample question: How does 3-DES differ from DES when encrypting data?
1. Able to identify key hash types such as MD5, SHA-1 and LM. Sample question: Which type of hashing method has been used for a hash code of “5D41402ABC4B2A76B9719D911017C592”? Related material: [here](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/md5).
1. Understand how passwords are stored and the weaknesses of these methods. Sample: What methods might an intruder use to determine the passwords on a system, giving the hashed values of the passwords?
1. Understand the methods used for the Diffie-Hellman method. Sample: Outline the process of how hosts use the Diffie-Hellman method, in order to generate a share secret key. [here](https://asecuritysite.com/Encryption/diffie).
1. Understand the range of tools which could be used to crack hashes, such as for MD5, LM and NTLM. Sample question: Give an example of a Kali Linux tools that could be used to crack LM, and outline its operation? Related material: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENp-tDJn1uY).
1. Define the salting process for passwords. Sample question: What are the key advantages of using a salt value for a password?
1. Explain how public key provides both privacy and identity verification.
1. Understand how the RSA process works, with a simple example.
1. Understand how the Elliptic Curve process works, with a simple example.
1. Understand how the Diffie-Hellman process works, with a simple example.
1. Understand how the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman works, with a simple example.
1. Understands how the private key is used to check the identity of the sender, and how public key is used to preserve the privacy of the message.
1. Explain how the e and d values are determined within the RSA method. Where would I find this info? There are some examples [here](https://asecuritysite.com/log/rsa_examples.pdf).
