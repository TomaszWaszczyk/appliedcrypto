# Assessments
The module has two core learning outcomes:

* LO1: Explain and demonstrate a critical understanding of specific cryptographic algorithms and cryptosystems.
* LO2: Implement, critically analyse and evaluate fundamental areas related to state-of-the-art cryptography related area, including current literature, practical implementation and evaluation.

The first test accounts for 40% of the overall mark, and the coursework accounts for 60%. The assessments are:

* Test 1 [here](https://github.com/billbuchanan/appliedcrypto/tree/master/z_assessments/test01).
* C/W [here](https://github.com/billbuchanan/appliedcrypto/tree/master/z_assessments/coursework).
