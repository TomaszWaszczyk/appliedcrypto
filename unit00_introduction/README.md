# Unit 0: Introduction

## Units
The units involved in the module are:

* Ciphers and Fundamentals.  
* Symmetric (Secret) Key. AES, ChaCha20.
* Hashing and MAC. MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
* Asymmetric (Public) Key. RSA and Elliptic Curve.
* Key Exchange. Diffie-Hellman, ECDH.
* Digital Signatures and Digital Certificates. 
* Tunnelling. Tunnelling, including SSL/TLS.
* Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain. Outline of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins, Ethereum and more.
* Future Cryptography. Outline of areas such as Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge proofs and Quantum-robust cryptography.
* Host security.

The module uses Teams as the main communication channel. There is also a Teams session each Friday at 6:30pm.

We will be using a Ubuntu machine for the practical elements of the module. The VM can either be sourced on vSoC or can be downloaded from [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtLuQYeqHsJljfBbjVakRcSGIsQ3GA?e=DgvMbM). You can download VMWare Workstation or VMWare Fusion from [here](https://softcentre.soc.napier.ac.uk/users.cgi). A demo of using the VM is here:
