# Investigation of Tokens, Authorization and Docker
The key concepts are:

* Token creation and usage, including JWT, Fernet, OAuth and ERC20.
* Federated ID systems.
* Outline of the usage of Docker for building security infrastructure for SSH and authorization.

## What you should know at the end of unit?

* Define how ERC-20 tokens are used within Ethereum.
* Understand the scope of tokens and how they could be used for authorization.
* Define the signing methods used in tokens, such as with HMAC and RSA, and the weakness of token which are not signed (OAuth)
* Able to setup a simple Docker container which implements a security function.
